## About Me
I am pursuing my Master's in Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley. 

## My Repositories
Here are some of my key projects:

- [Pain Level Estimation Project](https://github.com/niha-m584/2022-2023_HDSI_Project): HDSI Scholarship for 2022-2023 (Michael, Niharika, Prof. Shang): Using Computer Vision to Detect Pain Level Estimation for Patients. This project aims to estimate the pain levels of hospital patients using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict a pain score ranging from 0 to 7. Developed with the Keras framework in Python, this model provides a robust classification solution for healthcare applications.
  
- [Google Rating Prediction](https://github.com/niha-m584/google_rating_prediction): This project examines a dataset of Google restaurant reviews, including user IDs, business IDs, ratings, text reviews, and attached images. Notably, the ratings are skewed towards higher values, with 68% being 5-star ratings, as shown in a pie chart. The dataset includes 9782 businesses and 200,000 records from 169,380 users. Our primary task was to predict a userâ€™s rating for a business based on features such as review text. We experimented with various models, including logistic regression with TF-IDF for text processing, SVD, and ALS. The logistic regression model, particularly with a TF-IDF vector length of 750 and a regularization constant of 7, achieved the highest accuracy of 73.1%. This model outperformed the baseline models, highlighting the significance of incorporating textual data into predictive modeling. The project's findings emphasize the importance of feature selection and model tuning in achieving high prediction accuracy.
